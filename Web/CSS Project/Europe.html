                <h3>Kakslauttanen arctic resort</h3>

                <p>Holiday is such a short period that you probably want to get all the fun out of your special days. That’s why we have designed our place in a way that allows you to enjoy Lapland’s nature and culture comprehensively starting from personal accommodation. </p>

                <p>From inside one our glass igloos, you can admire the northern lights and the twinkling of the bright, starry sky with your loved one – in the comforting warmth of room temperature. Under the glass roof you’ll find your own toilet, beds for two people and an additional bed, should you need it. Showers and saunas are available in separate buildings, with separate facilities for men and women. Our glass igloos are available right through the northern lights season, which begins around the third week of August and finished around the end of April.</p>

                <p>Our Kelo-Glass igloos combine the comforting warmth of our cosy log cabins with the sensational views of our world-famous glass igloos. Sleeping up to six and featuring a private sauna, fireplace, kitchenette, and a bedroom with a stunning glass roof, they’re made from Lapland’s unique Kelo pinewood. Take in the enchanting beauty of the northern lights and the Lappish wilderness from the comfort of your own private hideaway. </p>

                <p>A night in one of our snow igloos is an unforgettable experience. Rarely does anyone get the chance to sleep as cosily as they do in an ice-cool igloo that shields them from even the faintest outside noise. Even if the mercury dips to minus 40 degrees centigrade outside, the temperature inside is a consistent minus three to minus six. We’ll provide everything you need for a cool, comfortable night in, such as a down sleeping bag. </p>
