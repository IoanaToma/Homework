                <p>Immerse yourself in the luxury of the Fiji Islands. This unique and opulent opportunity offers couples, families and perhaps even battered backpackers a place to relax and rejuvenate amid a flourishing postcard-perfect paradise.You can see happiness from here. </p>

                <p>Taveuni, aptly named Fiji’s Garden Isle, is the country’s third largest island and is comprised of one very large, but dormant,volcano. Steeped in nature’s sweetest secrets, with a Mataqali (family) of friendly Fijians charged as her caretakers, the island and surrounding waters are home to the Rainbow Reef, one of many world-famous dive sites; Lake Tagimoucia, the hiding place of the fabled Tagimoucia flower; Bouma National Heritage Park, Waitavala Waterslide and Lavena Point, which each boast several majestic mid-jungle waterfalls; as well as Ravilevu Nature Preserve and Taveuni Forest, two of the island’s most prolific bird sanctuaries.</p>

                <p>Incredibly, the island offers even more. Eco-industry abounds here, keeping the island in its presently pristine condition. The land is laden with organically grown fruit, root and vegetable gardens. Fresh fish are sustainably farmed. Even the sweet-smelling coconut and frangipani massage oils are sourced from the islands own natural resources and created using practices passed down through generations of earth-aware Fijians. </p>

                <p>With so much natural beauty, tradition and inherent culture, it’s easy to see why discerning vacationers and enchanted expats,along with their fellow Fijians, have been hiding away here all these years. </p>

                <p>Our Treehouse, the highest house on the property, is fitted out with the finest of Fiji furniture. Stress mysteriously disappears as you ascend the steps to your treetop retreat, turn and take in the view of Somosomo Strait stretching as far as the eye can see. Paradise looms at every angle… especially from the sprawling deck which runs the length of the structure and houses a hammock, chaise lounge chairs, outdoor dining area and even a secret stone shower where you can soap up in style beneath the sunny (or starry) skies. Inside, you’ll find the hardwood floors coupled with locally hand-made furniture make quite a cozy sitting and sleeping space. Soft leather warrior-style club chairs create the perfect space to curl up with a cup of tea and a good book, a beautifully draped four-poster bed sets the scene for romance uninhibited, and if things get too hot, just fold open your glass paneled front wall to let in the soft sea breeze. </p>
